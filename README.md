# Project Title

Python Media Scanner

## Description

The Python Media Scanner is a desktop utility for organizing, analyzing, and comparing large media collections (like drives full of movies, music, or photos).
It’s designed for users who want to quickly check their drives for files that have multiple copies across different drives or just for taking inventory.
It’s particularly handy when dealing with large external hard drives, USB sticks, or network folders that contain mixed file types.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed.

Install requirements (if you haven't already):
```
pip install tkinterdnd2 pillow matplotlib

```
Optional (but necessary for duration detection):
- FFmpeg
- pymediainfo
- mutagen
```
pip install pymediainfo mutagen

```
### Installing/Executing

Just download the 4 files and open a terminal in the folder where the files are stored.
Then run:
```
python main.py

```
The program itself is pretty self-explanitory. Just press on 'Scan' and choose a folder.
